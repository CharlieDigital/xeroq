Xeroq always has an ***initiator side*** (where the form is) and a ***capture side*** (where the user will capture an image using a device or possibly upload a file from a remote location).

## From the initiator

This is how we can start the initiator side:

```js
  xeroqInit({
    // The URL that displays the capture interface
    interfaceUrl,

    // The URL of the signaling server
    signalingServer,

    // The function to be invoked when the connection is ready
    readyFn: (qr, id, url) => {
      // TODO: Display the QR code or URL
    },

    // The function to receive the photo
    blobReceivedFn: handleBlob
  });
```

Here's a simple example of the handler function where we'll just display the photo:

```js

/**
 * Invoked when a blob is received from the remote capture side.,
 * @param photo An `ArrayBuffer` which contains the received blob
 */
function handleBlob(photo: Uint8Array) {
  console.log(photo)

  const app = $divById("app")

  const photoDataUrl = "data:image/png;base64,"
    + arrayBufferToBase64(photo)

  app.innerHTML += `
    <br />
    <img src="${photoDataUrl}" />
  `

  // TODO: Add a hidden input to upload it
}

// https://stackoverflow.com/a/9458996/116051
function arrayBufferToBase64( buffer: ArrayBuffer ) {
  var binary = '';
  var bytes = new Uint8Array( buffer );
  var len = bytes.byteLength;
  for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      binary += String.fromCharCode( bytes[ i ] );
  }
  return window.btoa( binary );
}
```

You can do anything you want with the photo like sending it for extraction, additional processing, etc.

## From the remote device

Here's a basic example of implementing the capture side of the flow:

```js
const sessionId = params.get("sessionId")

const xeroq = xeroqCapture(sessionId, {
  signalingServer,
  connectFn: (sid) => {
    // TODO: Connected! Enable buttons, etc.
  }
```

That's it!

You can let the user capture a photo or select a file to upload; the actual user interface is entirely up to you.

Once the user takes a photo or selects a file, we'll transmit it to the initiator:

```js
// blob is a Uint8Array which contains the binary contents
// of the file
await xeroq.sendBlob(blob)
```

Yes.  That's it.  That's all there is to it.

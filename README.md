# Xeroq

Ever start filling out a form on your desktop that asks you for a picture of your ID?  Then you whip our your phone and upload the picture to Google Photos, download it on your desktop, and then upload it on your desktop?

Xeroq aims to solve this by providing a serverless, peer-to-peer, WebRTC based solution to allow developers creating forms to easily add form controls to get images from a device onto a desktop or from one device to a form flow started on another device.

Xeroq does this by directly connecting the two sides using WebRTC and then using a data channel to pass the information between them.
